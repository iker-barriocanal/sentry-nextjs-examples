This is an example of how to use Sentry with different use cases.

You can find the original example in the [examples of the NextJS repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-sentry).

Have a look at this example [deployed on Vercel](https://sentry-nextjs-examples-vercel.vercel.app/).
